# Social-Network-Analysis-Project

The project is based on the TV show "Survivor". Over each episode in the show, the ties or connections keep varying. Contestants vote out each other in each episode. By leveraging this data of votes for each episode which can be translated into ties(friendship and enemyship) and then computing centrality measures, I built a machine learning model that is able to predict the winner of the season in the early half of the season itself. Using core-periphery and coreness values, I proposed a consolidated strategy to win this show.
